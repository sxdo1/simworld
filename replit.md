# 3D City Simulator Game

## Project Overview
A fully-fledged 3D city simulator game using React and Three.js inspired by SimCity's GlassBox engine. The game features agent-based simulation, comprehensive economic systems, multiplayer support, and modular building upgrades.

## User Preferences
- Wants in-depth comprehensive and optimized economic system
- Multiplayer system implementation
- Recognizable buildings for each zoning type and service buildings
- Construction animations for all zoning buildings
- Service buildings can be placed instantly with modular upgrade system
- In-depth and comprehensive but optimized traffic simulation and road construction system
- Easy curved road construction capabilities
- All buildings must be placed next to roads
- Tariffs and export services with pricing systems
- City influence mechanics and tax systems
- Loan system that increases with city level/experience
- Achievement system tied to population milestones and construction goals
- Imported goods system for businesses and residents
- Mailing/postal system for city services
- Internet infrastructure system
- Financial simulation for businesses (location-based, salaries, expected income)
- Office zoning and buildings addition to R/C/I system
- Education system with job market influence
- Citizen status simulation (educated/uneducated, employed/unemployed, housed/homeless)
- Terrain value system determining wealth levels and supply/demand zoning
- Comprehensive optimization and debugging phase
- Plans to use this as a base game for further expansion

## Project Architecture

### Core Systems
1. **Agent-Based Simulation Engine** - Individual agents for Sims, vehicles, resources with status tracking
2. **Advanced Traffic System** - A* pathfinding, traffic flow optimization, vehicle agents
3. **Road Construction System** - Straight, curved, intersection handling, road types
4. **Economic System** - Wealth-based segregated loops, supply/demand, tariffs, exports, taxes, loans, business financials
5. **Zoning System** - Residential, Commercial, Industrial, Office with density progression
6. **Terrain Value System** - Land value determines wealth levels, supply/demand zoning mechanics
7. **Infrastructure** - Roads, utilities (power, water, sewage), internet, mail
8. **Import/Export System** - Goods trading, business supplies, resident needs
9. **Services** - Fire, Police, Health, Education with modular upgrades
10. **Education & Employment System** - Schools, universities, job market, unemployment tracking
11. **Construction System** - Animated building construction for zoned areas
12. **Achievement System** - Population & construction milestone tracking
13. **Multiplayer Framework** - Real-time city sharing and collaboration

### Technology Stack
- React 18+ with TypeScript
- @react-three/fiber for 3D rendering
- @react-three/drei for utilities
- Three.js for 3D graphics
- WebSocket for multiplayer
- Zustand for state management
